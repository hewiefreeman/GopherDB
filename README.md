# GopherDB
GopherDB is an in-memory distributed database for user authentication, leaderboards, and generic database storage. GDB uses a powerful schema validation mechanism to keep your data organized, with the ability to fine-tune to your exact needs.

Much like MongoDB, GopherDB uses JSON as it's query/response language and means of storing data on the disk. Where GDB excels is the simplification of the query process, allowing you to target and manipulate any piece of data in an entry as a hierarchy of `Object`, `Array`, and `Map`. This not only makes building queries easier, but they're also more readable to your colleagues than ever. On top of that, GDB has built-in number type arithmetic, and `String`, `Object`, `Array`, and `Map` manipulation methods (eg: append, prepend, delete, etc) using the same query format.
